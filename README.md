# EscapeFromIsland
The objective of this assignment is to write a "C" program which estimates the probability that an explorer will safely escape from a dinosaur- and volcano-infested island ("Jurassic Island") by taking random walks across it. As well as calculating the probability of escape, the mean and standard deviation of the path lengths should be determined for each starting cell
